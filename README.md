# PassLock

## Description

I started this porject because sometimes I have trouble coming up with a randoe password for myself, so I got motivated to make a random password generator.
Other people can use the website if they have want a different password for themselves or anyone. When building this site I learned how to use JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When using this site you click on generate a password then a couple of prompts should come up on what you would like in your password. If you want
certain amount of characters then if you want upper case or lowers case with special characters. After it should auto generate a password based on
the ones you accepted or denied.
